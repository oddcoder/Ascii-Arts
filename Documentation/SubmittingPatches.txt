	How to Get Your Change Into the Ascii Arts


If you do not have a repository with the current  source handy, use
git to obtain one.  You'll want to start with the mainline repository,
which can be grabbed with:

  git clone https://github.com/oddcoder/Ascii-Arts.git 

it is alwayes recommended to create your changes a branch other than main
branch. You can create new branch using the git command:


git branch branch_name

once you have created your branch you can switch to it with git command: 
git checkout branch_name
now you can ceate your changes to your branch
once you finish you can get a patch file with this command
git format-patch master..branch_name
and you got your patch!
now you can send it in email to ahmedsoliman0x666<at>gmail.com
it will take up to 15 days to get your patch applied you got no response
please send the patch again.
