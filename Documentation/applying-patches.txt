	Applying Patches 
	----------------

What is a patch?
---
 A patch is a small text document containing a delta of changes between two
different versions of a source tree. Patches are created with the `diff'
program.
To correctly apply a patch you need to know what base it was generated from
and what new version the patch will change the source tree into. These
should both be present in the patch file metadata or be possible to deduce
from the filename.


How do I apply or revert a patch?
---
Patches are applied using git version control system. Before applying a patch
patch must be checked so that you know what should the patch do.

`git apply --stat mypatch.patch`

This command does not apply any patch at all. It just gives you a chance to
check what does the patch do. After you have checked that everything is fine
it is time to apply patch

`git apply mypatch.patch`

note that applying patch does NOT commit the patch to the master branch 
after checking that everything is fine with your patch you can 
apply and commit it with the command 
`git am mypatch.patch`
